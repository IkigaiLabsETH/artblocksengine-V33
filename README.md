"Picture a world where the digital brushstrokes of generative artists aren't just admired, but become integral, living components of brand ecosystems. Enter Ikigai Labs XYZ's latest groundbreaking venture: a symphony of generative art, powered by Art Blocks Engine and amplified through our Dutch auction house. In partnership with ArtForA Journal, we're not just minting NFTs; we're unleashing exclusive plotter prints and evolving entire art series that redefine what primary market sales can be. How do we assure the perfect price? Our Dutch auction format, adopted from the pioneers at Art Blocks, starts high and descends until the first bid hits—voila, price discovery solved, and market sentiment captured on-chain. This is no mere 'sale'; it's a cultural event with 99 unique artworks that become artifacts of our exploration into the algorithmic art cosmos. It's not just about selling art; it's about building a blockchain-based, artist-first universe."

## Art Blocks Engine

Art Blocks Engine allows the generative NFT minting technology used by artists at Art Blocks to be integrated with Ikigai Labs XYZ. Engine allows to release generative outputs using AB smart contracts and rendering infrastructure resulting in Ikigai Labs XYZ generative projects. We will own our smart contracts and can use them to release new gen art series. We will do a collab with https://journal.artfora.com/ so that we can offer plotter prints. Time to reach out to info@artblocks.io Ikigai Labs XYZ may soon launch a Dutch auction format. The sale will inaugurate the launch of an auction house’s Gen Art Program powered by Art Blocks’ Art Blocks Engine — the company’s generative art solutions platform that provides technical infrastructure support for brands looking to expand their generative minting capabilities. The sale will be conducted entirely on-chain via Ikigai Labs. It will feature an exclusive series of 99 unique artworks that build LTL's early forays into algorithmic art. The integration of the Art Blocks Engine is a new avenue for generative artists to bring primary market works to sale. The Gen Art Program will highlight artists. Ikigai Labs will explore Dutch auctions. This method, which has been used by Art Blocks since its inception in 2021, starts at a fixed initial price and decreases at set increments until the first bid is placed. The ceiling price is set at x ETH. The format is perfect for price discovery. Several Web3 platforms have experimented with the Dutch auction format. Most recently, the NFT marketplace Foundation announced a dynamic pricing feature for NFTs that utilizes the method to better reflect market sentiment and remove the guesswork when it comes to an artist pricing their pieces.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
