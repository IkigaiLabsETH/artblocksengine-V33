// 3D Perlin noise field
// 3D rendering library needed three.js, which has built-in support for lighting models
// This code sets up a 3D canvas and initializes a 3D array (the scalar field) with Perlin noise values. 
// In the draw function, it rotates the scene and then uses the Marching Cubes algorithm to extract and render the surface from the scalar field.
// The Marching Cubes algorithm is a complex algorithm used in 3D graphics to create a polygonal representation of isosurfaces within volumetric data. 
// There are libraries available that implement the Marching Cubes algorithm, such as the isosurface package available on npm. 
// Implementing the Marching Cubes algorithm from scratch in p5.js would be a significant undertaking, as it's a complex algorithm that involves 3D geometry and data structures.
